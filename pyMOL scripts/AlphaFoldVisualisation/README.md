# Visualising AlphaFold/ColabFold structures


## Getting Started

### What you will need

* pyMOL 
* python

### For pLDDT visualisation : 

* open pyMOL
* in command line type : run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bh00mika/ColabHub/main/pyMOL%20scripts/AlphaFoldVisualisation/colbyplddt.py?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABVW4ZDNKEAY6QTVTNSCRUBSYVMZJEA
* load your output PDB file from AlphaFold. This file contains pLDDT scores in the b factor column.
* type colbyplddt yourstructurename and hit enter
* Voila! now your structure is coloured by plddt scores.
